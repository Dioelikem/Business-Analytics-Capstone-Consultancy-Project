# Business-Analytics-Capstone-Consultancy-Project
This Microsoft PowerPoint-based report represents the culmination of a 4-month consultancy project completed as part of my 1-year postgraduate Business Analytics program at Seneca College
  
**Project Highlights**:
  - Comprehensive Data Analysis: Managed and analyzed a large and complex data sets, proffering actionable insights / recommendations to address real-world challenges in Canada.
  - Leadership & Execution: successfully spearheaded the project from inception to completion, overseeing task allocation, timelines, and collaborative team efforts.
  - Practical Application of Skills: applied a robust mix of analytical tools and methodologies, showcasing the practical application of knowledge gained during the course.
    
**Technical Tools and Techniques**:
- Excel: Performed initial data wrangling, processing, and quality assurance was performed on a 30,000 rows data on wait time for various medical procedures. We ensured data quality by assessing the number of inconsistency for Data Consistency, the Ratio of Missing value for Data Completeness, the Ratio of Data to Errors for Data Accuracy, the Number of duplicates for Data Uniqueness and the Ratio of Inappropriate Data format for Data Orderliness. Dedupication was done and the ratio of error to Data was less than 1%. Also, there were no outliers.
- Tableau: Executed data merging (full inner join), appended tables, and performed regression analysis to predict the outlook of the pandemic if trends continued and recommendations were proferred to address the crisi.
- Python (Google Colab): Leveraged Python for natural language processing, including creating a Word Cloud based on A 5000 text corpus from the Fraser Report.
  
**Key Takeaways**:
- This project was an invaluable opportunity to demonstrate the integration of technical and storytelling skills, which are critical for effective data-driven decision-making. It also reinforces the principle that "Knowledge is not power until applied" â€“ Dale Carnegie.
- By blending tools like Python, Tableau, and Excel with strategic thinking and communication, the project exemplifies my skills in leveraging data to drive actionable insights in real world.
